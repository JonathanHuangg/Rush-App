This is just a document to explain how firestore works

Firestore - flexible, scalabale noSQL cloud database
- organized into collections and documents like folders and files
- collection: group of documents (not data)
- Document - record in Firestore that contains data 

Relational Databases - Uses tables with rows and columns. Relationships are defined using keys
- Schema: fixed schema
- Scales vertically (more power)

NoSQL Databases - Collections and documents, key value pairs, graphs. Related data stored together
- Schema: no or flexible schema
- Scales horizontally (add more servers)
